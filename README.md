# P5.js Sketch

This repository is a study project that I've created to learn, sketch and use the P5.js Library in some future projects.

## P5.js

The [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a JavaScript library created to optimize artistic programming.

## How to use the sketches

You doesn't need to download or install anything, the library is already referenced at each HTML file.
